# modelwrangler examples

Here are a couple examples for how to use modelwrangler.
* `MNIST_Classification_Exmaple.py` walks through how to run a feedforward convolutional new over the MNIST image database to do digit classification
* `MNIST_Autoencoder_Exmaple.py` walks through how to run a convolutional autoencoder over the MNIST image database to come up with a low dimensional representation
* `MNIST_Siamexe_Example.py` walks through buildling and training a siamese network that learns to put similar-looking digits next to each other

To run any of these examples, run `python ./<example_name>` while insied the `./examples` directory
