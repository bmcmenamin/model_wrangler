# model-wrangler

I have a number of side-projects using tensorflow and/or keras, and I found myself constantly re-implementing the same pieces of boring model-wrangling code -- saving/restoring weights, dividing datasets into train/test samples, etc. So I decided to make a general package or reusable network pieces.

I also wanted to get more familiar with the guts of TensorFlow so I could start building unconventional networks that may not be easy to do with Keras.


## to-do
This hasn't been tested at all yet, so don't use it.

Here's my to-do list:
* Add unit tests
* Add TensorBoard integration
* Set up simple toy problems as demos in a notebook
* Implement models from side projects into this format
