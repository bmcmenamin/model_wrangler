# model_wrangler Tests

When I started out, I had envisioned writing a tonne of unittests and making this a legit package.

But after a few days, I realized that that sounded boring and I'd probably end up dropping the whole project if I had to spend my free time doing unit tests. So I've opted to store various end-to-end tests I used for troubleshooting here.
